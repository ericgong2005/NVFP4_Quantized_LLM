Question: "What is LLM model quantization?" Response: "Quantization is a core tool for developers aiming to improve inference performance with minimal overhead. It delivers significant gains in latency, throughput, and memory efficiency by reducing model precision in a controlled wayâ€”without requiring retraining."
Question: "What is the benefit of LLM Quantization" Response: "Quantization enables us to trade excess precision typically needed during training for faster inference and a smaller memory footprint. Performance gains depend on how much of the network we quantize, the difference between native and quantized precision, and the algorithm we use."
